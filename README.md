# digital_transport_GOVHACK2021
This is a repository with information of the tool developed for my govhack2021 entry.

This was developed using R and Shiny. All the scripts as well as the databased can be found in the final app folder.

This can be used if the app cannot be run from the server. If this is the case, the app can be run from locally installed files.

## Data sources
This toll drew data from different publically available sources. Here are the main ones:

All Wellbeing Measures: https://www.data.act.gov.au/dataset/All-Wellbeing-Measures/b5kg-deh8

Canberra Metro Light Rail Transit Feed - Trip Updates (Historical Archive): https://www.data.act.gov.au/Transport/Canberra-Metro-Light-Rail-Transit-Feed-Trip-Update/jxpp-4iiz

Daily Public Transport Passenger Journeys by Service Type: https://www.data.act.gov.au/Transport/Daily-Public-Transport-Passenger-Journeys-by-Servi/nkxy-abdj

Vehicle registrations by motive power: https://www.data.act.gov.au/Transport/Vehicle-registrations-by-motive-power/x4hp-vihn

## The online tool

Link: https://phoneapps.shinyapps.io/digital_transport_govhack2021/

The online tol has been developed to be used by both people who are interested on ACT and open spaces, as well as personnel from institutions inetrested in having all this material in one place.

## Visualisations
This tool has been designed to be as user-friendly as possible. The apporach was to have simple yet highly easthetically data plots.

## As fast as a click
The aim was also to allow users navigate the tool with simple clicks on tabs and dropdown menues. I hope this facilitates the maximisation of the rich data.
